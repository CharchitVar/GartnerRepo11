For Database Question

I've converted the Mysql code to the MSSQL server code.
I've considered status 1 means active and 2 means Inactive in the User Table as it is not mentioned in the demo database.
I've considered say status in listing 2-- for basic and 3 for premium in the listing table as it is not mentioned in the demo database.


For Coding Question

1. Path of the feed product folder 

	GartnerCodingProblem\bin\Debug\net5.0

2. Provide the input as mentioned in the question

3. If time would not be a constraint, I would love to do the UI part so the application would not need the console for running or could handle the exception more efficiently.

4. If GartnerTestproject is not loaded please add the reference of the GartnerTestproject in the GartnerCodingProblem Solution, to make it work.
